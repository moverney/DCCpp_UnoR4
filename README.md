# What is DCC++ Uno R4

The goal of this project is to port DCC++ BaseStation from Gregg E. Berman https://github.com/DccPlusPlus/BaseStation to the Arduino Uno R4 Wifi.

Due to the Uno R4 Wifi capability, the base station will only require 2 components:
1. An Arduino Uno R4 WiFi board 
1. An Arduino Motor Shield.
